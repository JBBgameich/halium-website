	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>Earlier it was suggested to our projects that we should collaborate with other
	communities working on making GNU/Linux available to android phones, and that
	idea made lot of sense to us. Below is some details about the current situation
	and how this idea aims to solve it.</p>

	<p>Currently Ubuntu Touch, SailfishOS/Mer, Plasma Mobile and others have
	different android source trees and methods on how our stacks are built. There is
	lot of fragmentation on the following areas:</p>

	- Android source tree<br>
	- How android init is started (droid-hal-init vs lxc container vs chroot
	etc..)<br>
	- How images are flashed to device, (flash cm first v/s flash system directly)<br>
	- ...<br>

	<p>But ideally these parts wouldnâ€™t need to be separate, because we all have the
	same goal in the end. Each OS make use of android binary drivers using projects like
	libhybris, ofono, libcamera, audioflinger glue etc.</p>

	<p>Instead of being fragmented and everyone having to do the same job in a different way we have come up with idea to have a common base for all the OSs. The common base would include Linux kernel + Android HAL + libhybris shared between all the OSs. Less fragmentation would mean more common resources and would be a huge boon for porting efforts.
	This kind of approach would have the following benefits:</p>


	- Shared porting effort, port once and use everywhere<br>
	- More streamlined HAL<br>
	- Makes it easier for other distributions to run on mobile devices<br>
	- Common ground for communication between the different projects<br>
